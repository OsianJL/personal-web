          Hi, I'm Osi√°n Jorge Lezcano, a passionate software developer who loves crafting digital experiences.
          My journey began with a curiosity for technology, which quickly grew into a deep appreciation for software 
          craftsmanship, clean code, and creative problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.paragraph}>
          Throughout my career, I have embraced challenges that push me beyond my comfort zone, constantly learning 
          and adapting to new tools and technologies. I have experience with modern web technologies such as 
          TypeScript, React, Node.js, and Python, and I'm always excited to work with innovative projects that 
          aim to make a difference.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.paragraph}>
          Besides coding, I have a passion for music, and I believe that creativity in one area of life fuels 
          creativity in others. When I'm not working, you'll likely find me jamming on my guitar or exploring new genres.
        </p>
